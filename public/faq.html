	<h2>How do I stake Wownero?</h2>
	<p>
		This staking method is non-custodial, meaning you have compete control over your private keys.
		<b>500 WOW is the minimum amount</b> needed to earn rewards from staking.</p><p>
		You will need to have two wallets: a new wallet, which will be used to lock the funds in ("<b>wallet A</b>") and
		a second wallet with some WOW ("<b>wallet B</b>").<br>
		Do not use <b>wallet A</b> for ordinary transactions, think of <b>wallet A</b> more as a "<b>CD account</b>".
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Download latest <a href="https://git.wownero.com/wownero/wownero/releases">Wownero binaries</a></li>

		<li>Open terminal, run <code>wownerod</code> to sync with network (takes about 30 minutes)</li>

		<li>Once synced, open new terminal tab, run <code>wownero-wallet-cli</code>, create a new wallet ("<b>wallet A</b>"), write down the
			seed and keep it safe offline, just in case your need to recover the wallet!</li>

		<li>In another tab, open a second wallet with some WOW ("<b>wallet B</b>")</li>

		<li>From <b>wallet B</b>, transfer the amount you would like to lock + some change to cover the transaction fees
			(something like 0.05 WOW)
			to <b>wallet A</b>.
		</li>

		<li>
			Go back to <b>wallet A</b>, wait for the transaction to be confirmed (takes about 15 minutes, but could take up to
			an hour depending on network activity)
		</li>

		<li>Once transaction balance is "unlocked" (type <code>refresh</code> and balance to check status), lock the whole balance of
			<b>wallet A</b> for 1 year (10,5192 blocks) by sending the balance back to the same wallet. Type <code>address</code> to see
			walletâ€™s main address and then enter:

			<code>locked_sweep_all ADDRESS 105192</code></li>
		<li>
			Confirm the transaction (carefully check the address and number of blocks) and then take note of the
			transaction ID ("TXID").
			The WOW is sent back to the <b>wallet A</b>, but the amount will be locked for 1 year. After the time has elapse,
			the WOW is automatically released and spendable again, at which point you could sweep out the balance or
			re-lock balance for another year.
		</li>

		<li>
			Now you will need to get the transaction key ("TXKEY") using the TXID:
			<code>get_tx_key TXID</code>
		</li>
	</ul>
	You are done with the wallet part. Type save and exit.<br>

	<ul>
		<li>Set up

				Avalanche</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="stake.html">Submit staking</a> with the following informations:<br>

			<code>TXID<br>
			TXKEY<br>
			Main address of <b>wallet A</b><br>
			Avalanche C-chain address<br>
			</code>
		</li>
	</ul>

	Once the rewards program is launched on 1 January 2022, 1:1 tokens will be sent to your Avalanche address.<br>
	<h2>Can anybody steal my Wownero?</h2>
	<p>
		To staking Wownero you don't have to send private keys;
		it's only required the transaction key so that the quantity and veracity of the tx can be verified.
	</p>
	<h2>Once i locked my wallet, can I unlock it?</h2>
	<p>
		No. Please be careful, as once the wallet is locked you will have to wait one year before accessing your funds again.
